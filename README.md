## ‚ú® Features

### Build and ship real software 
Unlike other platforms, with Clairview you build and ship single page applications. Clairview applications have performance baked in and can be designed responsively, providing users with a great experience.
<br /><br />

### Open source and extensible
Clairview is open-source - licensed as GPL v3. This should fill you with confidence that Clairview will always be around. You can also code against Clairview or fork it and make changes as you please, providing a developer-friendly experience.
<br /><br />

### Load data or start from scratch
Clairview pulls data from multiple sources, including MongoDB, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Airtable, S3, DynamoDB, or a REST API. And unlike other platforms, with Clairview you can start from scratch and create business apps with no data sources. [Request new datasources](https://github.com/clairview/clairview/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

<br /><br />

### Design and build apps with powerful pre-made components

Clairview comes out of the box with beautifully designed, powerful components which you can use like building blocks to build your UI. We also expose many of your favourite CSS styling options so you can go that extra creative mile. [Request new component](https://github.com/clairview/clairview/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

### Deploy with confidence and security
Clairview is made to scale. With Clairview, you can self-host on your own infrastructure and globally manage users, onboarding, SMTP, apps, groups, theming and more. You can also provide users/groups with an app portal and disseminate user management to the group manager.

## Clairview Public API
As with anything that we build in Clairview, our new public API is simple to use, flexible, and introduces new extensibility. To summarize, the Clairview API enables:

- Clairview as a backend
- Interoperability


#### Docs
You can learn more about the Clairview API at the following places:

- [General documentation](https://docs.clairview.com/docs/public-api): Learn how to get your API key, how to use spec, and how to use Postman
- [Interactive API documentation](https://docs.clairview.com/reference/appcreate) : Learn how to interact with the API

<br /><br />
